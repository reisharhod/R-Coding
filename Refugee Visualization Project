# Memo Discussion

For this project, I explore data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s annual count of people granted refugee status between 2006-2015. [This dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhs/refugee-report) can be downloaded from Kaggle.
I created a time-based visualization (heatmap) to find a story in the data.

The heatmap graphic shows that out of all continents, Asia had the most refugees admitted to the U.S. nearly every year from 2006 to 2015. We also see that 2009 was an interesting year as that year the peak number of refugees came to the U.S. from Asia. Also, Europe and the Americas had the lowest number of refugees throughout this time frame, and Africa had the second highest amount of refugees admitted to the U.S., but again, Asia had the highest amount across all years except for 2006. 

Next, assessing the heatmap graphic according to the principles of design:
CONTRAST: I removed the grid lines and gray background to allow the heatmap to be more distinguished with a white background. Also, the title is bolded to help add contrast to the words. The viridis plasma color palette helps add contrast as well, that is appealing for color-blind users as well. 

REPETITION: The sans font is used throughout and the subtitle helps affirm that one focus of this graphic is the time period across 2006 to 2015. 

ALIGMENT: The title and subtitle having left alignment helps add contrast with the center of the graphic, and the right aligned caption also helps add contrast. As I’m still learning how to operate R & this is my first time using Illustrator, I couldn't figure out how to correctly trim the x-axis to show only 2006 - 2015 so that needs better alignment.

PROXIMITY: Similar to my note above, due to my continued learning of the tools, the axis limits and tick marks need better spacing. There is better spacing with the legend, but I originally wanted the legend on the bottom of the graph, but struggled with knowing how to spread out the legend numbers since there was a lot of overlap.


Lastly, regarding Alberto Cairo’s principles of great visualizations:
Truthful: The graphic shows the data without adding errors to the original raw data.
Functional: The graphic has a purpose in comparing the total number of refugees admitted to the U.S. based on continent and each year. 
Beautiful: The viridis plasma color palette adds great pops of color & contrast to the graphic.
Insightful: The heatmap shows a clear contrast, specifically with high numbers of Asian refugees coming to the U.S. during this time period. 
Enlightening: We could do further research and review to determine why there was a higher rate of Asian refugees in 2009 compared to other continents. 


# Clean Up the Data

```{r clean-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)    # For ggplot, dplyr, and friends
library(countrycode)  # For dealing with country names, abbreviations, and codes
library(lubridate)

refugees_raw <- read_csv("data/refugee_status.csv", na = c("-", "X", "D"))

non_countries <- c("Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "North America", "Oceania", 
                   "South America", "Unknown", "Other", "Total")

refugees_clean <- refugees_raw %>%
  # Make this column name easier to work with
  rename(origin_country = `Continent/Country of Nationality`) %>%
  # Get rid of non-countries
  filter(!(origin_country %in% non_countries)) %>%
  # Convert country names to ISO3 codes
  mutate(iso3 = countrycode(origin_country, "country.name", "iso3c",
                            custom_match = c("Korea, North" = "PRK"))) %>%
  # Convert ISO3 codes to country names, regions, and continents
  mutate(origin_country = countrycode(iso3, "iso3c", "country.name"),
         origin_region = countrycode(iso3, "iso3c", "region"),
         origin_continent = countrycode(iso3, "iso3c", "continent")) %>%
  # Make this data tidy
  gather(year, number, -origin_country, -iso3, -origin_region, -origin_continent) %>%
  # Make sure the year column is numeric + make an actual date column for years
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         year_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))
```

# Summarize the Data
```{r summarize-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

(refugees_continents_cumulative <- refugees_clean %>%
  group_by(origin_continent, year_date) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(origin_continent) %>%
  group_by(origin_continent) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_total = cumsum(total)))
```

# Create a Time-Based Visualization

```{r create-intermediate-graphic, fig.width=10, fig.higth=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

(mp2plot <- ggplot(data = refugees_continents_cumulative,
       mapping = aes(x = year_date, y = origin_continent, fill = total)) +

  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = rel(1.6)),

        axis.text = element_text(family = "sans", size = rel(1.1)),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", family = "sans", size = rel(1.3))) +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "",
       title = "Total Number of Refugees Admitted to the US by Continent",
       subtitle = "2006 - 2015",
       caption = "Source: Deparment of Homeland Security"))

```

# Output the Intermediate Graphic as a PDF file (to Enhance in Adobe Illustrator)

```{r output-intermediate-graphic, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggsave(mp2plot, filename = "output/miniproject2graphic.pdf", width = 12, height = 10)
```

# Place the Final Graphic in Markdown
